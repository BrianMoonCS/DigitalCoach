# Interview Feedback Methodology

## Big Five Personality Trait Approximation
Our initial approach attempted to map interview behavior to the Big Five personality traits:
- **Openness to experience**
- **Conscientiousness**
- **Extraversion**
- **Agreeableness**
- **Neuroticism**

**Limitations:**
- The Big Five personality traits are normally assessed through validated psychometric questionnaires, not brief video analyses
- Short interview clips provide insufficient data for personality assessment
- The correlation between isolated interview behaviors and personality traits is weak
- Personality trait scoring is less actionable for interview improvement
## Competency-Based Feedback
Added a competency-based approach that directly measures interview skills:

- **Communication Clarity**: Structure, articulation, and organization of ideas
- **Confidence**: Projected self-assurance and comfort with the material
- **Engagement**: Ability to maintain interest and connect with the interviewer

**Advantages:**
- Directly applicable to interview improvement
- Provides specific, actionable feedback
- Based on concrete observable behaviors
- Offers targeted recommendations

## Implementation Details

### Data Sources

Our feedback system analyzes multiple channels:

1. **Facial Analysis**: Emotional expressions and their frequencies
2. **Audio Analysis**: Tone, sentiment, speech rate, and patterns
3. **Text Structure**: Organization and coherence of responses

### Scoring Methodology

Each competency is scored using specific relevant signals:

- **Communication Clarity**: Text structure, speech rate, pauses
- **Confidence**: Positive vs. negative facial expressions, voice tone
- **Engagement**: Emotional variation, speech pattern variation, keyword usage
