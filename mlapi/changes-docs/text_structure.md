# Text Structure Analysis
## Overview
The text structure analysis component evaluates how well-structured a user's response is. This is important for assessing communication clarity and organization of thoughts.
## Current Implementation
The system uses a hybrid approach:
1. **Rule-based Analysis**: Examines text for structural elements like:
   - Paragraph count and distribution
   - Transition words and phrases
   - Introduction and conclusion presence
   - Sentence variety and length
2. **ML-based Analysis**: Is enabled to supplement the rule-based approach and is a weighted combination of the two both as the ML model is not fine-tuned. 
## Recommendations for Future Development
### Option 1: Enhanced Rule-based System 
- Add more sophisticated linguistic rules
- Incorporate domain-specific structure expectations
- Tune weights based on user feedback
### Option 2: Fine-tuned Pre-trained Model 
- Use a model like BERT or RoBERTa as the base
- Fine-tune on a dataset of structured vs. unstructured responses
- Models to consider:
  - `distilbert-base-uncased` (fine-tuned on structure data)
  - `roberta-base` (with classification head)
## Integration Guidelines
When implementing the ML approach:
1. Start with a pre-trained model with good generalization
2. Create a small, high-quality labeled dataset specific to your domain
3. Fine-tune the model on this dataset
4. Maintain the rule-based system as a fallback
5. Use a weighted combination of both approaches initially
